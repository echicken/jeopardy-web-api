# jeopardy-web-api
REST API for scraped J! Archive data (Jeopardy categories &amp; clues) (node.js)

You'll need to generate a *clues.db* file using
[this](https://github.com/whymarrh/jeopardy-parser) very helpful scraping tool, 
which in turn pulls its data from [this](http://j-archive.com/) very extensive
site.
